**We can help your clinical modeling project!** MITRE provides services to help non-profits develop open-source detailed clinical models. MITRE's FHIR team can provide informatics, modeling, terminology, HL7 standardization, and clinical resources to facilitate FHIR development. For an example of MITRE's work, see the [mCODE Implementation Guide](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mCODE-ig/branches/master/index.html).

# About CIMPL

CIMPL (**C**linical **I**nformation **M**odeling **P**rofiling **L**anguage) is a specially-designed language for defining clinical information models. It is simple and compact, with tools to produce [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) profiles, extensions and implementation guides (IG). Because it is a _language_, written in text statements, CIMPL encourages distributed, team-based development using conventional source-code control tools such as Github. CIMPL provides tooling that enables you to define a model once, and publish that model to multiple versions of FHIR.

CIMPL is open source and free for public use.

If you have questions, comments, or need help, please contact the CIMPL team on the [CIMPL FHIR chat channel](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/197290-cimpl), or log an issue on the [CIMPL Jira Issue Tracker](https://standardhealthrecord.atlassian.net/secure/BrowseProjects.jspa).

CIMPL was created by the [MITRE Corporation](http://www.mitre.org). 

**We can help your clinical modeling project!** MITRE provides services to help non-profits develop open-source detailed clinical models. MITRE's FHIR team can provide informatics, modeling, terminology, HL7 standardization, and clinical resources to facilitate FHIR development. For an example of MITRE's work, see the [mCODE Implementation Guide](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mCODE-ig/branches/master/index.html).

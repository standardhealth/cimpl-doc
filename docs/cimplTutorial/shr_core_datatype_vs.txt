#preferred_code			"The preferred, standardized code for interoperability purposes. There should be only one coding in a CodeableConcept with this tag."
#source_code			"The code found in the information source for this entry, e.g., the raw, original, or first encoding."
#user_selected_code		"The code was directly selected by the user, as opposed to being determined after the fact via interpretation of notes or natural language processing."
#derived_code			"The code was determined after-the-fact from source data, either through translation, or via interpretation of free text (by human or machine)."
#category_code			"Indicates the code is a less specific term or a categorization of the source or standard code, i.e., a hypernym. For example, a code for 'vital sign' in the context of a body weight measurement would be a category code. Category codes can  be useful for search and query purposes."

#default_code			"The code was supplied by the system by default, because no specific coded value was available."

ValueSet:       BodyLocationVS
Description:    "Codes that describe normal and pathologic anatomic systems, regions, cavities, and spaces. The code set includes codes from the SNOMED CT hierarchy descending from 123037004 'Body Structure'.

Body location is a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases. 

* Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.
* Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.
* Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:
    - Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and 
	- Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location. 

Note that BodyLocation is a data type (a reusable structure), not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5)."

ValueSet:       LateralityVS
Description:    "Terms that specify the side of the body.

+ Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.

ValueSet:       LandmarkTypeVS
Description:    "The type of feature that constitutes the landmark, for example, particularly if the landmark is an acquired body structure or physical object. The landmark type value set is part of BodyLocation, a flexible structure that allows the location to be determined by a single code, or a code plus laterality and/or orientation. The body location can also be specified in relation to one or more body landmarks. SNOMED CT is used in all cases. 

+ Code only: The code should include (precoordinate) laterality and/orientation to the degree necessary to completely specify the body location.
+ Code plus laterality and/or orientation: The basic code augmented by codes specifying the body side and/or anatomical orientation.
+ Relation to landmark: The location relative to a landmark is specified by:
    - Establishing the location and type of landmark using a body site code and optional laterality/orientation, and 
	- Specifying the direction and distance from the landmark to the body location. 

Note that BodyLocation is a data type (a reusable structure), not a stand-alone entity. The concept is similar to how a postal address can apply to a person, location, or organization. This contrasts with FHIR's stand-alone BodySite (aka BodyStructure in r4) which 'is not ... intended for describing the type of anatomical location but rather a specific body site on a specific patient' (FHIR 3.5)."
